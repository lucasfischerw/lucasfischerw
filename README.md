### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

</br>

I am Lucas Fischer, a Systems Analysis and Development student at Unisinos - RS, Brazil, currently enrolled since the 2024/1 term. My journey in programming began in 2017 with a focus on robotics. For over 7 years, I participated in numerous national robotics championships, honing my skills and contributing to advancements in the field.</br>

In 2021, I started my path as a freelancer, where I have developed over 70 projects, utilizing a variety of tools and technologies. Today, I continue to work on system development for both national and international clients. Additionally, I share my knowledge of programming for robots as an educator at Sinodal School.</br>

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow in the technology sector. Here you can find some of my adventures in the world of coding
